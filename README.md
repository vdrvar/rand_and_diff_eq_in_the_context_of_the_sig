# Randomization and Differential Equations in the Context of the Signature

Simulations related to a Master's Thesis at TU Munich.

This repository contains simulations related to the technique of the randomized signature map and its accompanying results. The goal is to improve the understanding and application of the signature method in machine learning and data analysis.

## Overview

I theoretically improved and implemented a method for learning rough path trajectories using multidimensional analysis, neural differential equations, and randomization. The main focus is on the randomized signature, a key object in this approach.

## Randomized Signature Equation

The equation defining the key object, the randomized signature, is as follows:

## Example Visualization

Here's an example of how this object looks for a theoretically defined stochastic process:

## Real-World Application

This is what the high-dimensional object may look like when applied to real-world data:

After fitting a simple linear regression on the randomized signature, it is possible to get a decent reconstruction of a very hectic and nonlinear path:
