# Randomization and Differential Equations in the Context of the Signature
Simulations related to a Master's Thesis at TU Munich

In this repo, you can find the simulations related to the technique of the randomized signature map and accompanying results.

I theoretically improved and implemented (in Python) a method for learning rough path trajectories using multi-dimensional analysis, neural differential equations and randomization.

An equation that defines the key object, the randomized signature, is as follows:

This is what this high-dimensional object may look like when applied to real world data:

After fitting a simple linear regression on the randomized signature, it is possible to get a decent reconstruction of a very hectic and non-linear path:
